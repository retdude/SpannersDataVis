# Dev Set-up

In order to use and work on the spanner.py file, there are a few package dependencies that must be installed to your pyenv


1. First select the pyenv you want to use
    - To check your pyenv type `pyenv versions`, the version with the `*` is your current pyenv

2. Then pip install the following packages:
    - networkx
    - numpy
    - scipy
    - matplotlib

For example, type in your console `pip install networkx`
You will be able to check the status of these packages by typing `pip list` which will display the packages installed on your pyenv
